        We respect your privacy almost as much as we love floppy disks. Here&apos;s the scoop:

      <h2>What We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        Practically nothing. We’re too busy cataloging cassette players to spy on you. If we do collect anything, it’s probably just your IP address and maybe your suggestion for that obscure PDA you still cherish.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies? Only the Edible Kind</h2>
      <p>
        Our website might use cookies—not the warm, gooey kind your grandma makes, but the digital ones that help the site run properly and tell us how many people still remember MiniDiscs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Third-party services (like Google) may also use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to serve ads and collect analytics on our site. These help us understand visitor behavior and serve relevant content.

      <h2>Sharing Your Info</h2>
      <p>
        Nope. Nada. Zilch. We don’t sell, rent, or trade your info. You’re not a collectible—just someone with great taste in outdated tech.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take your data security seriously. No, really. We’ve locked it up tighter than a GameShark code book from 1997.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        If we ever update this, we’ll try not to make it boring. You’ll see the changes here, in all their nerdy glory.
